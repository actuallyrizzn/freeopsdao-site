To spider governance proposals from **DAOhaus**, we‚Äôll need to build a crawler that can extract, structure, and optionally archive proposals from their platform, even though they don‚Äôt offer an easy, consistent API for this. Here‚Äôs a strategy I‚Äôd recommend:

---

### üß† **Phase 1: Understand the Data Source**

DAOhaus governance proposals live across different frontends, but they typically involve:

* DAO-specific subdomains (e.g., `app.daohaus.club/dao/0x1/0x...`)
* Proposals usually fetched via their **subgraph** or **direct API endpoints**
* Often gated behind pagination, client-side rendering, or GraphQL

Start by picking a target DAO (e.g., UberHaus, RaidGuild, or any Moloch v2/v3 clone).

---

### üõ† **Phase 2: Architecture Planning**

**Tech Stack Recommendation**:

* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**:

  * `requests`, `aiohttp` for HTTP calls
  * `beautifulsoup4` or `lxml` for HTML parsing (if scraping UI directly)
  * `gql` for GraphQL queries
  * `pydantic` for schema modeling
  * `sqlite` or `PostgreSQL` for data persistence

**Key Modules**:

1. `dao_registry.py`: Tracks DAOs to crawl.
2. `proposal_spider.py`: Fetches proposals from each DAO.
3. `graphql_client.py`: Interfaces with the DAOhaus subgraph.
4. `storage.py`: Handles local database caching (and optionally pushing to IPFS or similar).
5. `scheduler.py`: Optional cron or asyncio-based scheduler for repeat crawling.

---

### üîç **Phase 3: Data Discovery**

DAOhaus uses **The Graph** for data. Here‚Äôs an example endpoint:

```graphql
https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/daohaus/molochv3-<CHAIN>
```

Try this basic query:

```graphql
{
  proposals(first: 10, orderBy: createdAt, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    title
    description
    status
    createdAt
    dao {
      id
      name
    }
    votes {
      memberAddress
      vote
    }
  }
}
```

Each chain has its own subgraph:

* `molochv3-gnosis`
* `molochv3-mainnet`
* `molochv3-polygon`

---

### üß™ **Phase 4: MVP Build**

**Initial Goals**:

* Input a DAO ID or URL
* Query the subgraph for proposals
* Store and print proposals in human-readable form (markdown, json, sqlite)

**Example CLI Usage**:

```bash
python spider.py --dao 0x123abc --chain gnosis
```

**Output**:

```json
{
  "dao": "UberHaus",
  "proposals": [
    {
      "id": "proposal-1",
      "title": "Upgrade to v3.2",
      "status": "passed",
      "createdAt": "2023-07-01",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### üß∞ **Optional Enhancements**

* Add **Markdown rendering** for proposals (to republish on a blog or archive)
* Allow for **filters**: by status, date range, tags
* Push to an **on-chain archive** or IPFS
* Schedule via **GitHub Actions** or **serverless cron**

---

### üß≠ Next Step I Recommend

I‚Äôll scaffold the GraphQL query system and a basic CLI-based MVP for fetching proposals from one DAO. If you like, I can deliver that as a Python script or build out a repo structure.

Want me to start with that, or do you want a web version from the jump?
